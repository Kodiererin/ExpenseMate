## Technical Details

### Required Permissions
- **Camera**: For barcode scanning functionality
- **Internet**: For Firebase data sync

### UPI Integration
- Uses standard `upi://pay` protocol
- Supports merchant UPI ID configuration
- Generates unique transaction references
- Validates payment amounts and details

### Data Storage
- Expenses stored in Firebase Firestore
- Includes barcode data and payment method
- Automatic data refresh after successful payment

## Configuration

### Merchant Details
Update the merchant UPI details in `utils/upiUtils.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_MERCHANT_DETAILS = {
  merchantUPIId: 'your-merchant@upi', // Replace with actual merchant UPI ID
  merchantName: 'Your Store Name', // Replace with actual merchant name
};
```

### UPI Apps
Add or modify supported UPI apps in `utils/upiUtils.ts`:

```typescript
export const UPI_APPS: UPIApp[] = [
  {
    name: 'App Name',
    packageName: 'com.app.package',
    icon: 'ðŸ”¥',
    deepLink: 'appscheme://',
    scheme: 'appscheme'
  },
  // ... more apps
];
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
1. **Camera Permission Denied**: Prompts user to enable in settings
2. **UPI App Not Installed**: Shows appropriate error message
3. **Invalid Payment Amount**: Validates amount before payment
4. **Network Issues**: Handles Firebase connection errors

### Payment Validation
